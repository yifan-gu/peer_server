For implementation:
We use array in our system to represent peers and chunks, this will make the
code reliable and easy to implement, however it also increase the memory consumption...
Also, it's slower than hashmap

Besides, in our control flow, we are planning to receive one packet at a time,
so actually, the ACK is not very accumulative. This will cause some problem if
the re-ordering is very frequent.
 
For testing:
More system tests are needed.
