Testing
======

Unit testing
------

We have written unit testing inside *srb/test* directory.

Compile testing bins command:

		$ Make test

then you can run:

		$ ./test/test_recv_message [params same as 'peer']

to listen on the port

and then, run these commands in another terminal:

		$ ./test/test_send_message [params same as 'peer']
or

		$ ./test/test_tcp_send [params]
or

		$ ./test/test_send_corrupt [params]

now you can see the result from the first terminal, if the transportation is
successful.


System testing
------

We've run test through several edge cases including:

- whohas/get timeout
- DATA/ACK timeout
- wrong hash
- invalid packet

in our peer server system.

We've also drawn several graphs to ensure TCP windowing is working as expected.
