tests for cp1:

For cp1, we first did some unit test on packet sending and receiving, to Make
the test bins:

$ Make test

then you can run:
$ ./test/test_recv_message [params same as 'peer']
to listen on the port

and then, run these commands in another terminal:
$ ./test/test_send_message [params same as 'peer']
or
$ ./test/test_tcp_send [params]
or
$ ./test/test_send_corrupt [params]

now you can see the result from the first terminal, if the transportation is
successful.

For system test, we have not written scripts for that yet, but we have tested
with peers implemented by other classmates, and validated the result.
